  MLOps is messy, but the value it can deliver for society is big, writes [Michail Eric](https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/mlops-is-a-mess/) in his blog. Shortly he observes the following trends:

  1) Closing the loop in ML systems 
  2) Declarative systems for ML 
  3) Real-time -ML 
  4) Mergining business insight tooling with DS/ML workflows 
  5) Better data management 
  
  and the following META-trends 
  1) Talent shortage 
  2) Increasing consolidation around E2E platforms 
  3) Cultural adoption of ML thinking (similar to DevOps): holistic systems thinking (break silos), augmenting feedback loops in products, and experimentation and learning.
