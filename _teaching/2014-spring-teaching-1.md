Because of the new study guide in Medialogy {>*BSc in 2014*<}, I have been involved in organization of the MED1-IP, which has been offered in its renewed form for the first time in 2014, and somewhat transitional in 2013. Similarly, the kick-off of SMC master's in 2014 provided an opportunity to organize the new mandatory and elective courses, and re-organize the existing ones. 

“Introduction to Programming” for MED1 B.Sc. students (semester 1, 5 ECTS) 
======
13 double lectures for two groups (2x2x45), and exercise sessions (group work on given programming and written exercises, with four teaching assistants). The total number of students: 240 (2013) / 130 (2014). Co-organization with research assistant Dannie M. Korsgaard. Since 2014, Dannie runs the course with the help of bachelor student assistants. It is one of the most popular courses in our Medialogy Education.

# "Embodied Interaction” for MED8/SMC8 M.Sc. students (semester 8, 5 ECTS)

4-6 double lectures (2x45), and study hours (group work on selected topics). The total number of students: 7 (2014). Co-organization with associate professor Sofia Dahl.
