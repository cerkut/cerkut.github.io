I am super excited for the new edition of Machine Learning for Media Experiences, with the TA Mubarik Jamal Muuse.

We will run the course mostly flipped, with three important workshops:

- A full day introduction and workshop on 5.9 @ 2.0.004 (Laborotarium)
- A full 2-day hands-on workshop on 25/26 September @ 2.0.004 (Laborotarium)
- A full 3-day workshop and project initiation on 9, 10 and 11 October @ Manufakturet.

The self-study material between and after the workshops is enlisted within each workshop. Our first session is September 5, Thursday
