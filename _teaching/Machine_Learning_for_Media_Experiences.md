I am super excited to orchestrate and teach the new course Machine Learning for Media Experiences with [George Palamas](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/141622), [Henrique Galvan Debarba](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/153014), and many guests.

The formal study plan description of the module can be found here [https://moduler.aau.dk/course/2022-2023/MSNMEDM1222?lang=da-DK](https://moduler.aau.dk/course/2022-2023/MSNMEDM1222?lang=da-DK)

We will mainly follow Microsoft's ML for beginners, from our own fork at [https://github.com/SMC-AAU-CPH/ML-For-Beginners](https://github.com/SMC-AAU-CPH/ML-For-Beginners) but complement it with individual material at each session in line with the curriculum.

Our first session is September 2, Friday.
