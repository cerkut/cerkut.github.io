This is a container for semester project ideas for the MED students.

The MED1-6 students should consider classical Signal Processing or AR/VR projects, whereas MED7 and above who take / took the Machine Learning Course (MLME) could also consider Machine Learning projects.

The following MATLAB-based external resource is a good place to think about the scope, content, context, and value of semester projects.

# 1. Mobile App for Exploration of Local Resources

Many small business owners struggle for customer attention / discovery in the greater Copenhagen Area. By using recommendation-based algorithms on mobile platforms, can you design and evaluate a mobile app to provide small businesses value over the more common, chain institutions?

## Variations / Ideas

- Gamification: narrative, timer, badges, points, or leader boards
- Evaluation:  user engagement, perceived usability.
- Camera-based recognition
- Machine Learning (for MED7 and above)
- Augmented Reality

## Example Hypothesis (P1)

Gamification can enhance user engagement on a mobile application, and encourage users to explore small businesses within the Greater CPH Area.
