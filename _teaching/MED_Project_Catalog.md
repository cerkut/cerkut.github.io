This is a container for semester project ideas for the MED students.

The MED1-6 students should consider classical Signal Processing or AR/VR projects, whereas MED7 and above who take / took the Machine Learning Course (MLME) could also consider Machine Learning projects.

The following MATLAB-based external resource is a good place to think about the scope, content, context, and value of semester projects: [MATLAB Excellence in Innovation Projects](https://github.com/mathworks/MathWorks-Excellence-in-Innovation)

# Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning
Denmark has a rich history of innovation in Quantum research, and aims to a big player in Quantum Computing. There is a [growing community, a national strategy, talent programs, and resources available](https://dqc.dk/) for the next generation of Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning professionals. Outside of Denmark, startups like [Moth Quantum](https://mothquantum.com/) strive to enable the next era of music, gaming and the arts with quantum computing technology.

# Mobile App for Exploration of Local Resources

Many small business owners struggle for customer attention / discovery in the greater Copenhagen Area. By using recommendation-based algorithms on mobile platforms, can you design and evaluate a mobile app to provide small businesses value over the more common, chain institutions?

## Variations / Ideas

- Gamification: narrative, timer, badges, points, or leader boards
- Evaluation:  user engagement, perceived usability.
- Camera-based recognition
- Machine Learning (for MED7 and above)
- Augmented Reality

## Example Hypothesis (P1)

Gamification can enhance user engagement on a mobile application, and encourage users to explore small businesses within the Greater CPH Area.

# Design, Deployment, and Evaluation of an Audio-Visual Breathing App

Regularizing breath have many proven health and psychology benefits. It is also a backbone of many completative practices, such as meditation or martial arts. Can technology help in regularizing people's breath?

## Variations / Ideas

- Gamification: subtle narrative, timer, badges, points, or leader boards
- Evaluation:  Interviews, physilogical logs,
- Microphone, Gyroscope, IMU, or Camera-based recognition
- Machine Learning (for MED7 and above)
- Augmented, Virtual, or Extended Reality, including native or Web-based XR
- Gradio, Flask, or Streamlit Deployment

## Example Hypotheses (P1)

* The users find it easy to practice breathing exercises with the help of the designed application.
* If audio-visual feedback for the breath input is provided to the user, then they will be able to focus on their breathing in appropriate manner.
* Breathing exercises are effective in reducing anxiety

# Marker-based / Markerless Augmented Reality on Mobile Devices

Can you help the cultural / creative sectors (CSSs) to reach new audiences using digital technologies. especially Augmented Reality? In collaboration with national / international CCS you will design digital applications for various devices, which will form connections between locations, personal experiences and artistic projects.

Exploring User Interaction of Location-Based, Time-Limited, Augmented Reality Experiences In Urban Environments", MSc Thesis, Aalborg University Copenhagen*

## Variations / Ideas

- Gamification: timer, game characters, leader boards
- Evaluation:  Interviews, physilogical logs, correlation analysis
- Markerless Augmented Reality using [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar) or [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/)
- Machine Learning (for MED7 and above)
- 3D Sound Spatialization using [3DTune-In](https://github.com/3DTune-In) tools

## Example Hypotheses (P1)

* Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) and scarcity are positively related to continuance intention using Augmented Reality
* FoMO and scarcity decrease enjoyment
* General FoMO is positively related to scarcity
* Audio/Visual Presence increases enjoyment
* Audio/Visual adoption increases enjoyment
