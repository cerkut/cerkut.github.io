This is a container for semester project ideas for the SMC students. The SMC7/8 students should consider classical Audio Signal Processing projects, whereas SMC9/10 students who take the Machine Learning Course (MLME) could also consider Machine Learning projects.

The following MATLAB-based external resources are good places to think about the scope, content, context, and value of semester projects.
