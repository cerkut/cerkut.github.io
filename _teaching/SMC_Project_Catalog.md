This is a container for semester project ideas for the SMC students.

The SMC7/8 students should consider classical Audio Signal Processing projects, whereas SMC9/10 students who take the Machine Learning Course (MLME) could also consider Machine Learning projects.

The following MATLAB-based external resources are good places to think about the scope, content, context, and value of semester projects.

* [MATLAB Excellence in Innovation Projects](https://github.com/mathworks/MathWorks-Excellence-in-Innovation)
* [MATLAB Annual Audio Plugin Competition Submissions](https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/?q=tag:%22aescomp%22&sort=date_desc_updated)

# Marker-based / Markerless Augmented Reality on Mobile Devices

Can you help the cultural / creative sectors (CSSs) to reach new audiences using digital technologies. especially Augmented Reality? In collaboration with national / international CCS you will design digital applications for various devices, which will form connections between locations, personal experiences and artistic projects.

## Variations / Ideas

- 3D Sound Spatialization using [3DTune-In](https://github.com/3DTune-In) tools
- Gamification: timer, game characters, leader boards
- Evaluation:  Interviews, physilogical logs, correlation analysis
- Markerless Augmented Reality using [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar) or [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/)
- Machine Learning (for SMC9 and above)

## Example Hypotheses (P1)

* Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) and scarcity are positively related to continuance intention using Augmented Reality
* FoMO and scarcity decrease enjoyment
* General FoMO is positively related to scarcity
* Audio/Visual Presence increases enjoyment
* Audio/Visual 3D adoption increases enjoyment

# Augmented Reality Audio
Since 2016, we have been using [Resonance Audio](https://resonance-audio.github.io/resonance-audio/develop/design-tips) in mobile Augemented Reality projects in real-time. Here is a short demo showing how we used in Google's Tango in real-time https://youtu.be/UP6wdnJQJz8 (also room and object scanning). The video ends up with an idea of extending the approach to outdoor scenes, esp. forests. Here are some pointers:

The perceivable changes in the forests acoustic environments are important for AR applications like https://eiwaztreeoflife.com/. Can you enchance the climate impact experience with an interactive and adaptive AR app and help saving the planet, in collaboration with Martine Jarlgaard? 

## Variations / Ideas

- Extending Resonance Audio with three / forest reverbs
- Gamification: 
- Evaluation: Interviews, physilogical logs, correlation analysis
- Machine Learning (for SMC9 and above)

## Example Hypotheses (P1)

* Tree/Forest reverb simulation  makes a positive impact on immersion for https://eiwaztreeoflife.com  
* Audio/Visual Presence through forest / tree reverb increases enjoyment
* Audio/Visual 3D adoption through occlusion increases enjoyment
