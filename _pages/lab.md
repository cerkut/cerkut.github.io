The lab focuses on Edge Intelligence and Spatial Web Standard to develop interactive tools that generate and process multimodal data. We train, evaluate, and engineer Generative AI models under the Active Inference framework. The continual training under uncertainty is performed on-prem, or using national HPC, including Quantum Hubs. The labâ€™s technical equipment includes Edge-enabled sensors and GPU/CPU-based AI edge computing platforms. With this infrastructure, we explore real-time human performances with XR Avatars, AI-enabled interfaces, reactive surfaces, and 3D spatial interaction. These new technologies can be applied in various fields, such as health (therapy and rehabilitation), embodied interaction and soma design, sonic interaction design, and cutting-edge media technologies.
