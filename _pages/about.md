[Edge AI](https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/), [Active and Perceptual Inference](https://www.activeinference.institute/), Quantum Computing (QC) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) will have a huge transformative potential and impact in the immediate future. My mission is to bridge X-verse, AI, and QC/QML through [Active and Perceptual Inference](https://www.activeinference.institute/) and academic/industrial [ML](https://github.com/chiphuyen/dmls-book) / [AI engineering](https://github.com/chiphuyen/aie-book) practices within the Spatial Web Standard, developed by the [Spatial Web Foundation](https://spatialwebfoundation.org) and the IEEE P2874 Spatial Web, Architecture and Governance Working Group. I work towards this mission within [my lab]({{ '/lab' | relative_url }}) through [collaboration]({{ '/lab' | relative_url }}) and scientific [projects]({{ '/projects' | relative_url }}).

I have a PhD on [acoustics and audio signal processing](http://legacy.spa.aalto.fi/) from Aalto University, Finland, with minor studies on [Information Systems (Machine Learning)](http://www.cis.hut.fi/) and general studies on Extended Reality. I have participated in national (Finland, Denmark, and Turkey) and international projects (EU Framework Programs 5-7, and Horizon programs). Between 2007 and 2012, I conducted independent research as an Academy Research Fellow on [sonic interaction design](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:sonic_interaction_design) (Schema-SID, #120583, Academy of Finland), together with the FP7 IC601 SID project on the same theme. At Aalborg University, I worked on [embodied interaction](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:embodied_interaction&after_author=48AAAFD1__8J&astart=10), neural sound and motion synthesis. and AI Engineering.

I am affiliated with the [Pioneer Center for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/people/cumhur-erkut), served at [Danish Data Science Academy](https://ddsa.dk/) as a mentor in 2023, participate to the steering commitee of [Movement and Computing (MOCO)](https://www.movementcomputing.org/about/) and to the program commitee of [EAAI Mentored Undergraduate Research Challenge](https://www.yetanotherfreedman.com/resources/challenge_haaisam.html).
