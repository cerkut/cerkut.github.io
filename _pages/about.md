I am an Asoociate Professor, researcher and lecturer at the [Multisensory Experience Lab](https://melcph.create.aau.dk/) of the [Aalborg University Copenhagen](https://www.en.cph.aau.dk/). I explore [Sound and Music Computing](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:sound_and_music_computing&after_author=100AAIXz__8J&astart=20), [Embodied Interaction](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:embodied_interaction&after_author=hMMWAH72__8J&astart=10), [Sound Synthesis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:sound_synthesis) and Audio Processing with Machine Learning for [Extended Reality](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:extended_reality&after_author=SUYOAHv1__8J&astart=10). 

I have a PhD on [acoustics and audio signal processing](http://legacy.spa.aalto.fi/), with minor PhD studies [Information Systems (Machine Learning)](http://www.cis.hut.fi/) and general studies on Extended Reality. I have participated in national (Finland, Denmark, and Turkey) and international projects (EU Framework Programs 5-7, and Horizon programs). Between 2007 and 2012, I conducted independent research as an Academy Research Fellow on [sonic interaction design](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:sonic_interaction_design) (Schema-SID, #120583, Academy of Finland), together with the FP7 IC601 SID project on the same theme. During this period, I worked on the emerging theme of rhythmic interaction, with real-time probabilistic machine learning models.

I am insterested in *Machine Learning Operations* or [MLOps](https://ml-ops.org), for short. With MLOps, I want to design, build and manage reproducible, testable, and evolvable ML-powered software that can work in real-time. I manage the  [Machine Learning Workstation](https://aalborg-university.gitbook.io/machine-learning-workstation) with 3 Titan X GPUs at AAU-Copenhagen, and am an avid user of [CLAAUDIA research data services](https://www.claaudia.aau.dk/) and [UCloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/dashboard).

I have affiliated with the [Pioneer Center for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/people/cumhur-erkut), serve in the steering commitee of [Movement and Computing (MOCO)](https://www.movementcomputing.org/about/) and int program commitee of [EAAI Mentored Undergraduate Research Challenge](https://www.yetanotherfreedman.com/resources/challenge_haaisam.html).
