<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

I am an Associate Professor at the [Aalborg University Copenhagen](https://www.en.cph.aau.dk/).
I explore [Sound and Music Computing](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:sound_and_music_computing&after_author=100AAIXz__8J&astart=20), [Embodied Interaction](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:embodied_interaction&after_author=hMMWAH72__8J&astart=10), [Sound Synthesis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:sound_synthesis) and Audio Processing with Machine Learning for [Extended Reality](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:extended_reality&after_author=SUYOAHv1__8J&astart=10), with my colleagues at [Multisensory Experience Lab](https://melcph.create.aau.dk/) 

I have a PhD on [acoustics and audio signal processing](http://legacy.spa.aalto.fi/), with minor PhD studies [Information Systems (Machine Learning)](http://www.cis.hut.fi/), and general studies on Extended Reality. I have participated in national (Finland, Denmark, and Turkey) and international projects (EU Framework Programs 5-7, and Horizon programs). Between 2007 and 2012, I conducted independent research as an Academy Research Fellow on [sonic interaction design](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:sonic_interaction_design) (Schema-SID, #120583, Academy of Finland), together with the FP7 IC601 SID project on the same theme. During this period, I worked on the emerging theme of rhythmic interaction, with real-time probabilistic machine learning models.

I am insterested in *Machine Learning Operations* or [MLOps](https://ml-ops.org), for short. 

With MLOps, I want to design, build and manage reproducible, testable, and evolvable ML-powered software that can work in real-time. 

I manage the  [Machine Learning Workstation](https://aalborg-university.gitbook.io/machine-learning-workstation) with 3 Titan X GPUs at AAU-Copenhagen, and am an avid user of [CLAAUDIA research data services](https://www.claaudia.aau.dk/) and [UCloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/dashboard).
