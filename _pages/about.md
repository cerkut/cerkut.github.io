I received my PhD in 2002 from Helsinki University of Technology, Finland, with a major on [acoustics and audio signal processing](http://legacy.spa.aalto.fi/) and a minor on [Information Systems (Machine Learning)](http://www.cis.hut.fi/). During my post-doc, I contributed to national and international projects in EU Framework Programs 5&6. Between 2007 and 2012, I conducted independent research as an Academy Research Fellow on sonic interaction design (Schema-SID, #120583, Academy of Finland), together with the FP7 IC601 SID project on the same theme. During this period, I worked on the emerging theme of rhythmic interaction, with real-time probabilistic machine learning models.


Since 2013, I work at the [Multisensory Experience Lab](https://melcph.create.aau.dk/) of the [Aalborg University Copenhagen](https://www.en.cph.aau.dk/). Besides AR/VR, my recent focus is on [differentiable programming](https://diffprogramming.mit.edu/) and [physics-based learning](https://www.physicsbaseddeeplearning.org) for neural audio and motion synthesis. I posit that this interpretable and explainable approach to machine learning will eventually solve the fundamental problems of deep learning: reasoning instead of mere mapping, and focus on optimizing well-understood real-time classical signal processing algorithms by inductive, structural biases instead of a generic black-box approach. 

To enable these outcomes, I currently look into an academic adaptation of *Machine Learning Operations* or [MLOps](https://ml-ops.org), for short. With MLOps, I aim at an end-to-end machine learning development process to design, build and manage reproducible, testable, and evolvable ML-powered software that can work in real-time. I currently maintain the  [Machine Learning Workstation](https://aalborg-university.gitbook.io/machine-learning-workstation) with 3 Titan X GPUs at AAU-Copenhagen, and am an avid user of [CLAAUDIA research data services](https://www.claaudia.aau.dk/).
