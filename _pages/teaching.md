# Machine Learning for Media Experiences

MSc,** ** *Aalborg University* , 2024

I am super excited for the 2025/26 edition of Machine Learning for Media Experiences, with the TA Signe Henriksen.

We will run the course mostly flipped, with two important workshops:

* A full day introduction and workshop on 8.9 @ @ Manufakturet.
* A full day hands-on workshop and project initiation on 17.11 @ 2.0.004

The self-study material between and after the workshops is enlisted within each workshop. Our first session is September 5, Thursday
