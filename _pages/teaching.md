## graudate courses (second cycle, MSc)

#### Machine Learning for Media Experiences, Fall term, 2019 -

In designing and developing interactive media systems and technology, we often look for interesting patterns and trends. This course presents theoretical concepts and practical tools for **analyzing data for multimedia applications** and solving **machine learning problems.**

- Formal Description: [https://moduler.aau.dk/course/MSNMEDM1222](https://moduler.aau.dk/course/MSNMEDM1222)
- Moodle (AAU access only): 2025: [55991](http://moodle.aau.dk/course/view.php?id=55991) 2024: [52521](http://moodle.aau.dk/course/view.php?id=52521 "2024 ed")

I am excited for the 2025/26 edition of Machine Learning for Media Experiences, with the TA Signe Henriksen.

We will run the course mostly flipped, with two important workshops:

* A full day introduction and workshop on 8.9 @ @ Manufakturet.
* A full day hands-on workshop and project initiation on 17.11 @ 2.0.004

The self-study material between and after the workshops is enlisted within each workshop.
