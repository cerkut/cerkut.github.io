In 2024, in many occasions I have pitched for an [Edge Intelligence](https://viso.ai/edge-ai/edge-intelligence-deep-learning-with-edge-computing/) infrastructure that can connect our labs and people's homes.

The last was the DIALOGUE WORKSHOP 14 MARCH 2024 - MISSION WELLBEING OF CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE at Aalborg.
